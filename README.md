# 3-Tier-web-Application-Architect

- This project was inspired by real-world enterprise needs â€” from security, scalability, and availability to hybrid connectivity and traffic inspection.

ðŸ”ŽArchitecture Highlights:



- Three-tier architecture (Web, App, DB) fully hosted in private subnets for enhanced security



- Gateway Load Balancer (GWLB) with Gateway Load Balancer Endpoints (GWLBe) to route traffic through EC2-based security appliances for deep packet inspection



-Auto Scaling Group (ASG) and Application Load Balancer (ALB) in the web tier for horizontal scalability and fault tolerance



- Multi-AZ deployment to ensure high availability across all tiers

- Hybrid connectivity established with the on-premises data center using a VPN Gateway, enabling secure communication with internal billing and inventory systems



- Ready for integration with third-party traffic analytics providers through centralized inspection points



- Internal routing managed across VPCs without peering, leveraging PrivateLink via GWLBe



- All inter-tier communication is inspected and secured before reaching backend systems



- This solution mirrors real enterprise environments where security and hybrid connectivity are crucial. It gave me hands-on experience with advanced services like GWLB, endpoint services, and hybrid routing at scale.
